# OTPHelper
A small tool for the 3DS console, for helping with the downgrade and OTP dumping process

**!Important Note: This tool is deprecated!**

The way to go for A9LH installations now is CTRNAND transfer (O3DS) or OTPless install (N3DS). The OTPHelper source code and releases will stay here just in case it may be useful at a later point. Always refer to [Plailects guide](https://github.com/Plailect/Guide/wiki) before doing anything stupid!
